### Objective
Language skills require maintenance. bilingüe gives all-in-one access to the tools you need to keep your Spanish language skills fresh.

------------------

### Motivation
I majored in Spanish in college. I worked with several Spanish speakers and was quite fluent by graduation. Living and working in an English speaking society, however, has made daily practice more difficult. I have notes scattered about of words to relearn or remember. I wanted a place to practice and maintain my skills that wouldn't get lost around the house.

-----------------

### Minimum Viable Product

* AAU I should be able to keep a list of English words I want to find Spanish translations for and vice versa.
* AAU I should be able to update these cards with translations as I find them.
* AAU I should find links to Spanish language social media.
